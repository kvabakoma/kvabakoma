- 👋 Hi, I’m @kvabakoma

This is Nikola Georgiev's main GitHub account. It is occasionally used by Kvaba Interactive employees as well. 

I'm an IT guy interested in game dev, educational software and open source projects. I'm the ex-founder of [Kvaba Interactive](https://kvaba.com), currently looking for new opportunities.

If you'd like to reach me:
