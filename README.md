🙌 Hi, I’m @kvabakoma - a.k.a. Nikola Georgiev 🤓

I'm an IT guy interested in game dev, educational software and open source projects. 

I'm also the founder of [Kvaba Interactive](https://kvaba.com) (non-operational anymore). 

Currently, I'm the Chapter Lead at the Commerzbank DTC Bulgaria CICD Cluster, where I focus on team leadership and AI product design and development.
